<h3> Delhi Weather Prediction and Visualization </h3>

<hr/>

<p> Predicting Temprature using Machine Learning. The Algorithem used for Prediction is Linear Regression. Features include temp, humidity, date, dew point </p>
<p> So far the testing score gives 90 - 93 % accuracy for testing data.</p>

<p> Data consists of 20 year of temprature record. Available at <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/mahirkukreja/delhi-weather-data"> here </a></p>

<p> The model can be run by executing model.py. Visualization of data has been done in data_visualize.py which shows the highest recorded data from each year.</p>
