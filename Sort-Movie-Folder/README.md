# Sort movies according to IMDB Ratings


A small script I made where you can add the path to your folder 
containing movies. Run this script, and it will sort
the movies in your folder according to the imdb ratings.
There is no need to change the name of the movie, it will
work on any format.

## Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- Python module beautiful soup and requests
- Internet connections and a movies folder

## Run:
 
Open the `sort-movies.py`, edit the top variable called
`MOVIES_DIR` and add your path to movies folder.
Run the script.
